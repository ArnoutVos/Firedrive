# Simple File Manager 

![Joomla 3.x.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Joomla-3.x.x-blue.svg)

**Simple** is a Joomla! component for creating private user areas and for organizing documents in safe download centers. It's very easy to use and to configure. 

There are dozens of nice document managers for Joomla already out there, but they are either:

-  not responsive
-  not flexible enough
-  not so user-friendly
-  have a lot of heavy and unuseful functionalities

Simple's main goal is to provide a simple, lightweight, responsive and safe component to easily share documents on your website. It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of SFM is to **keep the workflow as simple as possible:** if you need advanced features (often not expected to be in a document manager) please seriously think about using another component.

## Software requirements

Simple File Manager needs Joomla! 3.7+ and PHP 5.4+ to run. Also a running MySQL/MariaDB instance is required. 


## Installing

You can install Simple File Manager via the [Joomla Web Installer](https://docs.joomla.org/Install_from_Web).  

If you prefer to install it manually, download the latest release [from here](http://gmansillo.github.io/simple/) then login into your **Joomla! Administrative Panel** and upload the package into the **Extension Manager**. If you need further informations refer to the [official Joomla! documentation](https://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension).

## Missing stuff

Someone kindly pointed out to me that the following functionalities are missing in Simple:

-  Bacth file import system
-  Documentation: PHPDoc, Getting started documentation and landing page
-  Better accessibility using ARIA and other optimizations
-  Include bootstrap classes in component's css

I'll do my best for implementing these as soon as I can.
