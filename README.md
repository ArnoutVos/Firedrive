## About

**Simple File Manager** is a Joomla!&trade; lightweight component for easily creating safe and responsive **download centers** where to easily share public and private documents. It's very easy to install and configure. 

There are dozens of nice document managers for Joomla already out there, but they are either not responsive, not flexible enough, not so user-friendly, and have a lot of heavy and unuseful functionalities.

It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of SFM is to **keep the workflow as simple as possible:** if you need advanced features (often not expected to be in a document manager) please seriously think about using another component. 

If you're still not convinced, take a look to this lightning video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JLy4mNRd_E
