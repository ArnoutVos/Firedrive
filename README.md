Simple File Manager is a . It's very easy to use and configure. 

Simple File Manger is a simple Joomla! component that gives the possibility to create private user areas and to organize documents in safe download centers. There are hundreds of nice document managers for joomla already out there, but they are either:

-  not responsive
-  not flexible enough
-  not user-friendly
-  have unnecessary dependencies to other libraries
-  more annoying things

That's why I developed Simple File Manager and its goal is to solve all of the above issues.

##What is it made for?

Simple File Manager's goal is to provide a simple, lightweight, responsive and safe way to share documents on your Joomla! website.
