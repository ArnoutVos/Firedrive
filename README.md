**Simple File Manger** is a simple Joomla! component that gives you the possibility to create private user areas and to organize documents in safe download centers. There are hundreds of nice document managers for joomla already out there, but they are either:

-  not responsive
-  not flexible enough
-  not user-friendly
-  have unnecessary dependencies to other libraries
-  more annoying things

That's why I developed Simple File Manager and its goal is to solve all of the above issues.

##What is it made for?

Simple File Manager's main goal is to provide a simple, lightweight, responsive and safe component to easily share documents on your website. It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of SFM is to **keep the workflow as simple as possible:** if you need advanced features (often not expected to be in a document manager) please seriously think about using another component. 

##Example site

You can visit this Site http://www.simplefilemanager.eu/demo/ which is a test platform for Simple File Manager. I'm still developing and constantly adding new features but you can already use Simple File Manager in your websites as it has reached a stable and reliable state already.

##Version notes

I'm currently still heavily developing in order to make Simple File Manager better. Your help is needed! Please contribute to the project if you like the idea and the concept and suggest me what you think I should do in order to improve it.

###Important missing stuff

-  Bacth file import system
-  Documentation: PHPDoc, Getting started documentation and landing page
-  Better accessibility using ARIA and other optimizations
-  Include bootstrap classes in component's css
-  Search Plugin
