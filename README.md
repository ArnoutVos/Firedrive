Simple File Manger is a simple Joomla! component that gives the possibility to create private user areas and to organize documents in safe download centers. There are hundreds of nice document managers for joomla already out there, but they are either:

-  not responsive
-  not flexible enough
-  not user-friendly
-  have unnecessary dependencies to other libraries
-  more annoying things

That's why I developed Simple File Manager and its goal is to solve all of the above issues.

##What is it made for?

Simple File Manager's main goal is to provide a simple, lightweight, responsive and safe component to easily share documents on your website. It's important to understand that one of the main intentions of SFM is to **keep the workflow as simple as possible:** if you need advanced features (often not expected to be in a document manager) please seriously think about using another component.
