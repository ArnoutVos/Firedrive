Simple File Manger is a simple responsive document manager for Joomla! 3. There are hundreds of nice document managers for joomla already out there, but they are either:

-  not responsive
-  not flexible enough
-  not friendly
-  not user oriented
-  have unnecessary dependencies to other libraries
-  more annoying things

That's why I developed Simple File Manager and its goal is to solve all of the above issues.

##What is it made for?

Simple File Manager's goal is to provide a simple, lightweight and safe file manager to responsively show documents on your Joomla! website.
